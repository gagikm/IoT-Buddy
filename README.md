IoT-Buddy
=========

An iOS application for controlling Internet of Things devices.
Designed around the Electric Imp, but will work with any device that accepts an HTTP POST request.
The user enters values which are passed in the message body as "value={yourvalue}".
The app receives data back from the imp servers, but currently doesn't do anything with it.
