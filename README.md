IoT-Buddy
=========

An iOS application for controlling Internet of Things devices.
Designed around the Electric Imp, but will work with any device that accepts an HTTP POST request.
The user enters values which are passed as JSON in the message body like "value=2"
The app receives data back from the imp servers, but currently doesn't do anything with it.
